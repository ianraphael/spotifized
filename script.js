I'm better off all by myself Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cellphone Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh I'm better off all by myself Though I'm feelin' kinda empty without somebody else Oh, I hear you cryin' out for help But you never showed for me when I was ringin' your cellphone Oh, you don't know how it feels to be alone Baby, oh, I'll make you know, I'll make you know, oh"

Palubog na ang buwan Palitaw na rin ang araw Kwento natin ay nagsisimula pa lang Wag tayo mag alangan sa mga nakaraan Tuwid lagi ang daan wag paikot ikot lang Atin laging pagmasdan ang mga nakaabang Pag di na napuntahan lagi yang may paraan Tara na bitawan yang hawak na alak Halatang tinamaan ka na sorbesa Mga matang papikit pikit lakad mo di na tuwid Akong bahala sa iyo Mahal di kita pababayaan Itong gabi ay para sa atin Gawin mo lang ang gusto mong gawin Tulad ng mga bagay na di pa nagawa Tayo'y mag saya… mag saya Mag saya… mag saya Paumaga nanaman wag na tayong umuwi Anong pwedeng dahilan sa ating paglilibang? Palubog na ang buwan Palitaw na rin ang araw Kwento natin ay nagsisimula pa lang Wag tayo mag alangan sa mga nakaraan Tuwid lagi ang daan wag paikot ikot lang Atin laging pagmasdan ang mga nakaabang Pag di na napuntahan lagi yang may paraan May oras pa sa ating bulsa 'Di bale ng walang lamang pera basta may oras pa Heto nanaman hindi ako mapakali Gusto na makasama ka umaga hanggang sa gabi Gusto kitang makatabi Sa mga bawat na sandali Sa dalampasigan, ikaw ay aking aawitan Habang pinagmamasdan ko lang ang iyong kagandahan Napakasarap mo kasing titigan Ang mga problema kalungkutan ay nalilimutan Sindihan natin yung bonfire ilagay sa may tabe Pag nawala sa paningin hindi ako mapakali Mag uumaga nanaman o mamaya na umuwi Gusto kita na makasama pa mayakap pang muli Paumaga nanaman wag na tayong umuwi Anong pwedeng dahilan sa ating paglilibang? Palubog na ang buwan Palitaw na rin ang araw Kwento natin ay nagsisimula pa lang Wag tayo mag alangan sa mga nakaraan Tuwid lagi ang daan wag paikot ikot lang Atin laging pagmasdan ang mga nakaabang Pag di na napuntahan lagi yang may paraan May oras pa sa ating bulsa 'Di bale ng walang lamang pera basta may oras pa May oras pa, may oras pa May oras pa, may oras pa May oras pa, may oras pa May oras pa, may oras pa May oras pa, may oras pa l, aye! Gusto pa kitang makasamac, aye! Wag na tayong umuwi Sayo na 'ko pauwi, aye! May oras pa, may oras pa l, aye! Gusto pa kitang makasamac, aye! Wag na tayong umuwi Sayo nako pauwi, aye!"

Through, yeah And there's one thing that I need from you Can you come through? Ain't got much to do Too old for my hometown Went to bed at noon Couldn't put my phone down Scrolling patiently It's all the same to me Just faces on a screen, yeah I'm trying to realize It's alright to not be fine on your own Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee These last few weeks have been exhausting I'm lost in my imagination And there's one thing that I need from you Can you come through, through? Through, yeah And there's one thing that I need from you Can you come Through, through Through, yeah And there's one thing that I need from you Can you come through?"
